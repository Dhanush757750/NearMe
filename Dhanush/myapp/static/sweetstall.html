                One is lucky to eat like a Chettiar, they say in South India. Chettiars say it themselves. They say it because a Chettiar table is a groaning board but also because 
                the cuisine is uncommonly subtle and aromatic,  a heritage of Chettiar participation in the centuries-old spice trade

                Further non-vegetarian influences became entrenched in Chettiar food habits from the late 18th Century after they established businesses in Ceylon, Burma, the Dutch East Indies, French Indo-China and what is now Malaysia and Singapore. 
                So did non-vegetarian fare from other parts of India through which they traveled en route to their overseas businesses.
